# Doubts:
1) could not solve last question
    I thought of following:
   1) expand e^x , sin(x) using taylor series, but to know whether the errors is less than  1e-6 we need to use integration. (may be trapezoidal)
   2) we can use normal equations which is told in week 5. But not sure how to upper bound error.


## week5
Question 8) yet to complete

## week6
Question 3) animation
Question 5)

## week7


## week8




# Doubts
1) I think even for gauss-seidel emthod we need diagonally row domainant matrix for convergence
Ans: No, for gauss-seidel method it is not proved that it converges for diagonally dominant matrix.



2) In assign4_codes.ipynb, question 1
