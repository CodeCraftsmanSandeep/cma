Week5 short notes : <br/>
1) Interpolation vs curve fitting
2) Measure of fitness. (basically error)
3) Best-fit line, Best-fit polynomial 
   1) In normal equations we have summation.
   2) Only points (m points) are given. f is not given in any interval.
4) Best-fit polynomial (using integeration). f is given in some interval a, b
5) ILL-conditioned matrices
6) Orthogonal functions w.r.t to weight function w(x).
   1) Othonormal functions 
7) Legendre polynomail
8) Chebyshev polynomial
