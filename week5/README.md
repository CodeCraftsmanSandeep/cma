Week5 short notes : <br/>
1) Interpolation vs curve fitting
2) Measure of fitness. (basically error)
3) Best-fit line, Best-fit polynomial 
   1) In normal equations we have summation.
   2) Only points (m points) are given. f is not given in any interval.
4) Best-fit polynomial (using integeration). f is given in some interval a, b
5) ILL-conditioned matrices
6) Orthogonal functions w.r.t to weight function w(x).
   1) Othonormal functions 
7) Legendre polynomail
8) Chebyshev polynomial.
9) ??????????????????????????? (complete fourier and remaining 2 problems)


doubts from week5, week6:
1) week5 slides slide6
2) week5 slides slide7. Why often S is ill-conditioned.
3) code5 1st question: getting ill conditioned matrix. (this can be avoided without normal equations for n+1 > m)
4) code5 question6) are got c values are okay ??
5)
