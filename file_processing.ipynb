      "could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and\n",

      "some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.\n",

      "Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\n",

      "thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short\n",

      "stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin\n",
      "\n",
      "was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\n",

      "itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With\n",
      "\n",
      "trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew\n",
      "\n",
      "from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I\n",

      "\n",
      "on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my\n",
      "\n",
      "share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good\n",
      "\n",
      "might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s\n",
      "\n",
      "instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.\n",
